## About

Hi ðŸ‘‹, I'm a Computer Engineering student studying in Toronto, passionate about
computers and electronics. I was never into programming or computing beyond a
surface level when I was younger, so although starting fairly recently, it
quickly became one of my favourite hobbies. Today, I still considerably enjoy
learning about both software and hardware in addition to the topics presented in
my undergraduate classes.

## Projects

I like to host my projects and do most of my development at [git.4kb.net]. I'm
also on [GitHub] for public contributions and anything else. My work is a bit
split up between the two until I figure out a mirroring solution, but if I want
to show something off I'll usually post it to GitHub as well.

[GitHub]: https://github.com/kbujari

Some of my interests:

- Low power efficient computing
- Unix systems, mainly Linux and OpenBSD
- Signal processing related to images and audio
- Online privacy and security

## Contact

For any communication, use <mail@kleidi.ca>. If you use my [PGP key], take care
to attach a pubkey and I will respond accordingly.
