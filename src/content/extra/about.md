passionate about digital electronics and their applications.
I love `rust`!

## Projects

I like to host my projects and do most of my development at [git.4kb.net]. I'm
also on [GitHub] for public contributions and anything else. My work is a bit
split up between the two until I figure out a mirroring solution, but if I want
to show something off I'll usually post it to GitHub as well.

Some of my interests:

- Low power efficient computing
- Unix systems, mainly Linux and OpenBSD
- Signal processing related to images and audio
- Online privacy and security
