## _welcome!_

I'm a computer engineering student studying in Toronto,
passionate about digital electronics and their wide applications.

## Projects

I like to host my work and do most of my development at [src.web.4kb.net]. I'm
also on [GitHub] for public contributions and anything else. My work is a bit
split up between the two until I figure out a mirroring solution, but if I want
to show something off I'll usually post it to GitHub as well.

Some of my interests in the field:

- Low power efficient computing
- Unix systems, mainly Linux and OpenBSD
- Atomic and declarative distributed systems
- Memory-safe programming
- Online privacy and security
